A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table, and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near real-time.

Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified.

An e-commerce company has implemented AWS CodeDeploy as part of its AWS cloud CI/CD strategy. The company has configured automatic rollbacks while deploying a new version of its flagship application to Amazon EC2.

What occurs if the deployment of the new version fails?

+ CodeDeploy switches the Route 53 alias records back to the known good green deployment and terminates the failed blue deployment
+ AWS CodePipeline promotes the most recent working deployment with a SUCCEEDED status to production
+ The last known working deployment is automatically restored using the snapshot stored in Amazon S3
+ A new deployment of the last known working version of the application is deployed with a new deployment ID

<br>

<details close>
<summary>Note</summary>
CodeDeploy rolls back deployments by redeploying a previously deployed revision of an application as a new deployment. These rolled-back deployments are technically new deployments, with new deployment IDs, rather than restored versions of a previous deployment.

To roll back an application to a previous revision, you just need to deploy that revision. AWS CodeDeploy keeps track of the files that were copied for the current revision and removes them before starting a new deployment, so there is no difference between redeploy and rollback. However, you need to make sure that the previous revisions are available for rollback.

    mysql.close()
    return
```

On the first execution, the Lambda function takes 2 seconds to execute. On the second execution and all the subsequent ones, the Lambda function takes 1.9 seconds to execute.

What can be done to improve the execution time of the Lambda function?

**An ALB has three possible target types: Instance, IP and Lambda**

When you create a target group, you specify its target type, which determines the type of target you specify when registering targets with this target group. After you create a target group, you cannot change its target type. The following are the possible target types:

`Instance` - The targets are specified by instance ID
`IP` - The targets are IP addresses
`Lambda` - The target is a Lambda function

**You can not specify publicly routable IP addresses to an ALB**

When the target type is IP, you can specify IP addresses from specific CIDR blocks only. You can't specify publicly routable IP addresses.

A user has an IAM policy as well as an Amazon SQS policy that apply to his account. The IAM policy grants his account permission for the `ReceiveMessage` action on `example_queue`, whereas the Amazon SQS policy gives his account permission for the `SendMessage` action on the same queue.

Considering the permissions above, which of the following options are correct? (Select two)

+ If the user sends a `SendMessage` request to `example_queue`, the IAM policy will deny this action 
+ Either of IAM policies or Amazon SQS policies should be used to grant permissions. Both cannot be used together
+ The user can send a `ReceiveMessage` request to `example_queue`, the IAM policy allows this action
+ Adding only an IAM policy to deny the user of all actions on the queue is not enough. The SQS policy should also explicitly deny all action
+ If you add a policy that denies the user access to all actions for the queue, the policy will override the other two policies and the user will not have access to `example_queue`

A development team had enabled and configured CloudTrail for all the Amazon S3 buckets used in a project. The project manager owns all the S3 buckets used in the project. However, the manager noticed that he did not receive any object-level API access logs when the data was read by another AWS account.

What could be the reason for this behavior/error?

+ The bucket owner also needs to be object owner to get the object access logs
+ CloudTrail needs to be configured on both the AWS accounts for receiving the access logs in cross-account access
+ CloudTrail always delivers object-level API access logs to the requester and not to object owner

DevOps engineers are developing an order processing system where notifications are sent to a department whenever an order is placed for a product. The system also pushes identical notifications of the new order to a processing module that would allow EC2 instances to handle the fulfillment of the order. In the case of processing errors, the messages should be allowed to be re-processed at a later stage. The order processing system should be able to scale transparently without the need for any manual or programmatic provisioning of resources.

Which of the following solutions can be used to address this use-case?

+ SNS + Kinesis
+ SNS + SQS
+ SNS + Lambda
+ SQS + SES

A .NET developer team works with many ASP.NET web applications that use EC2 instances to host them on IIS. The deployment process needs to be configured so that multiple versions of the application can run in AWS Elastic Beanstalk. One version would be used for development, testing, and another version for load testing.

Which of the following methods do you recommend?


+ Create an Application Load Balancer to route based on hostname so you can pass on parameters to the development Elastic Beanstalk environment. Create a file in .ebextensions/ to know how to handle the traffic coming from the ALB
+ You cannot have multiple development environments in Elastic Beanstalk, just one development and one production environment
+ Use only one Beanstalk environment and perform configuration changes using an Ansible script
+ Define a dev environment with a single instance and a 'load test' environment that has settings close to production environment
