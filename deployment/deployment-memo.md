# Deployment-memo

**A retail company manages its IT infrastructure on AWS Cloud via Elastic Beanstalk. The development team at the company is planning to deploy the next version with MINIMUM application downtime and the ability to rollback quickly in case deployment goes wrong.**

**As a Developer Associate, which of the following options would you recommend to the development team?**

+ Deploy the new application version using 'All at once' deployment policy
+ Deploy the new application version using 'Rolling' deployment policy
+ Deploy the new version to a separate environment via Blue/Green Deployment, and then swap Route 53 records of the two environments to redirect traffic to the new version
+ Deploy the new application version using 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy
