# Solution Architect Exam#6 Practice Set
A multinational corporate and investment bank is regularly processing steady workloads of accruals, loan interests, and other critical financial calculations every night from 10 PM to 3 AM on their on-premises data center for their corporate clients. Once the process is done, the results are then uploaded to the Oracle General Ledger which means that the processing should not be delayed or interrupted. The CTO has decided to move its IT infrastructure to AWS to save costs. The company needs to reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone to properly run their workloads.

As the Senior Solutions Architect, how can you implement a cost-effective architecture in AWS for their financial system?

+ Use On-Demand EC2 instances which allows you to pay for the instances that you launch and use by the second. Reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone to avoid any interruption.
+ Use Regional Reserved Instances to reserve capacity on a specific Availability Zone and lower down the operating cost through its billing discounts.
+ Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.
+ Use Dedicated Hosts which provide a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs.

<summary>Note</summary>
On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.

Using Regional Reserved Instances to reserve capacity on a specific Availability Zone and lower down the operating cost through its billing discounts is incorrect because this feature is available in Zonal Reserved Instances only and not on Regional Reserved Instances.

A fast food company is using AWS to host their online ordering system which uses an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances deployed across multiple Availability Zones with an Application Load Balancer in front. To better handle the incoming traffic from various digital devices, you are planning to implement a new routing system where requests which have a URL of `<server>/api/android` are forwarded to one specific target group named "Android-Target-Group". Conversely, requests which have a URL of `<server>/api/ios` are forwarded to another separate target group named "iOS-Target-Group".   

How can you implement this change in AWS?
+ Use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the hostname in the host header. This enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer.
+ Replace your ALB with a Gateway Load Balancer then use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.
+ Use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.
+ Replace your ALB with a Network Load Balancer then use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.

A company has an application architecture that stores both the access key ID and the secret access key in a plain text file on a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The EC2 instances, which are created by using this AMI, are using the stored access keys to connect to a DynamoDB table.

What should the Solutions Architect do to make the current architecture more secure?
+ Put the access keys in Amazon Glacier instead.
+ Put the access keys in an Amazon S3 bucket instead.
+ Remove the stored access keys in the AMI. Create a new IAM role with permissions to access the DynamoDB table and assign it to the EC2 instances.
+ Do nothing. The architecture is already secure because the access keys are already in the Amazon Machine Image.

An application is using a Lambda function to process complex financial data that run for 15 minutes on average. Most invocations were successfully processed. However, you noticed that there are a few terminated invocations throughout the day, which caused data discrepancy in the application.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this issue?

+ The failed Lambda functions have been running for over 15 minutes and reached the maximum execution time.
+ The concurrent execution limit has been reached.
+ The Lambda function contains a recursive code and has been running for over 15 minutes.
+ The failed Lambda Invocations contain a `ServiceException` error which means that the AWS Lambda service encountered an internal error.

<details close>
<summary>Note</summary>
You pay for the AWS resources that are used to run your Lambda function. To prevent your Lambda function from running indefinitely, you specify a timeout. When the specified timeout is reached, AWS Lambda terminates execution of your Lambda function. It is recommended that you set this value based on your expected execution time. The default timeout is 3 seconds, and the maximum execution duration per request in AWS Lambda is 900 seconds, which is equivalent to 15 minutes.

<summary>Note</summary>
In Amazon Pinpoint, an event is an action that occurs when a user interacts with one of your applications, when you send a message from a campaign or journey, or when you send a transactional SMS or email message. For example, if you send an email message, several events occur:

- When you send the message, a send event occurs.

- When the message reaches the recipient's inbox, a delivered event occurs.

- When the recipient opens the message, an open event occurs.

You can configure Amazon Pinpoint to send information about events to Amazon Kinesis. The Kinesis platform offers services that you can use to collect, process, and analyze data from AWS services in real time.

Amazon Comprehend uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech, and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. You can also use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organizationâ€™s needs.

Amazon Textract is just an AI service used to extract text data from scanned documents in PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PDF formats and is not capable of running sentiment analysis. 

Furthermore, Grafana is more suited for the visualization of time-series data such as system metrics (CPU load, disk storage, memory utilization, temperature, etc)
